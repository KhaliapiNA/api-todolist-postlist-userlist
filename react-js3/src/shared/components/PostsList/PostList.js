                Urahara grew up in the Seireitei, the estate of the Shihōin family, along with childhood friends
                Yoruichi Shihōin and Tessai Tsukabishi.
                He joined the Gotei 13 around the same time that Yoruichi joined the covert operations unit.
                Over time, he became the third officer of the second detachment.
                When Yoruichi was promoted to the rank of Captain of the Second Squad, she was also the head of the
                Covert Operations Squad by then, and eventually merged the two units under her command. As one of the
                top five officers in the Second Squad, Urahara became head of the third division of the Undercover
                Operations Squad, the Detention Squad.

                Approximately 110 years ago, the captain of the 12th Division, Kirio Hikifune, was transferred to the
                Royal Guard. Yoruichi then recommended Urahara for the vacant seat. Yoruichi told Urahara about
                the vacant position after sparring at the training ground under Sōkyoku Hill. She informed him that she
                had recommended him for this position, and then returned to the barracks of the second detachment.
                Urahara then spent the entire day loitering around Soul Society, chatting with the residents and playing
                with the children. During this time, he was spied on by Sui-Feng, Yoruichi's bodyguard. At the end of
                the day, Sui-Feng returned to the 2nd Division Headquarters, finding Urahara already chatting with
                Yoruichi. She says that she cannot believe that Yoruichi would recommend such an irresponsible person
                for the captaincy.

                Yoruichi confirmed this and asked her to also come to the captain's test. She explained that normally
                only captains are allowed to attend, but she got a special permit for her. Sui-Feng was at first
                surprised why she had to go to the test, to which Yoruichi replied that there was no need to hide
                secrets anymore, since she knew that Urahara liked Sui-Feng. An embarrassed Sui-Feng denied this, but
                Yoruichi explained that she knew she had been chasing Urahara all day. Sui-Feng confirmed that she had
                been following him all day, but only to prove that Urahara was lazy and didn't deserve high marks from
                Yoruichi. She handed the notes to Yoruichi, who read them and noted how detailed she had described
                everything. When Urahara did not deny what was written in the report, Sui-Feng was shocked at how true
                his seeming lack of professionalism was. Yoruichi wasn't surprised and chuckled that Urahara never
                changes and also praised Sui-Feng for her reconnaissance abilities. At first, Sui-Feng rejoiced at the
                praise, until she realized that Yoruichi had treated her notes not as intelligence information, but as
                love notes. Sui-Feng remains rather depressed, but Yoruichi laughed at this and told her to relax since
                she wasn't serious. They were interrupted by an intelligence man who informed Urahara that they had
                found the one he was looking for. Yoruichi told him to finish his business quickly, and Sui-Feng sent to
                help prepare a test for the future captain. Urahara and his men reached the remote area where the
                fugitives were hiding. Urahara told his men to wait for him outside while he entered the building and
                defeated all the fugitives with Hakuda's techniques.
