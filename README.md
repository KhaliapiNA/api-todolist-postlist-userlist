This project is not finished yet. Tasks:
1. Create a few components just with some mock data:
- PostsList / TodoList / UserList / Navigation. Navigation - should be accessible on all pages
- Using react-router-dom implement navigation between these components.
2. To make this project interactive we will use https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/. We will request all data from there. This API provides us to use the REST API with GET/POST/DELETE endpoints.
3. Make each of the  items clickable to be able to change the state of  the complete field. The layout can be any of your choice.

Readme.md will be supplemented by the results of tasks on this project.
